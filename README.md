### Introduction:

I came up with this to build more self-awareness around my own emotions. Once you can starting tracking it, they can be regulated more easily as you can see common themes, incidences of set-backs, and then how it can affect others.

* Log feelings on a scale of 1-10
* Add comments to different feelings

### Wishlist:
* Beautiful fonts and general CSS styling
* Able to show how long ago feelings were created
